This project demonstrates how to create and access a TON (The Open Network) wallet programmatically, with a focus on deploying smart contracts or building automated bots that interact with the TON blockchain. In this tutorial-based repository, you will:

    Learn how to set up a TON wallet using popular wallet apps.
    Gain hands-on experience accessing and managing the wallet programmatically.
    Explore how to use this access for deploying smart contracts or performing blockchain transactions.
    Understand the underlying mechanics of TON wallets and their interaction with the blockchain.

Whether you are building a decentralized application (dApp), integrating TON payments into your bot, or exploring TON smart contracts, this project provides a comprehensive foundation for interacting with the TON network using code.
